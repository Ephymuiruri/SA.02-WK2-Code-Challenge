## Goals
**solve the Following:**
# Challenge 1 
Write a function that accepts a string as input and swaps the case of each character.This challenge has been solved in file `indexQ1.js`
## Description `index1Q1.js`
it is a JavaScript file that willswap case of any letter from upperCase to lowerCase and vice versa.For example if you input 'The Quick Brown Fox' the output should be 'tHE qUICK bROWN fOX'.
# Challenge 2 
Write a JavaScript function that accepts two numbers to generate an array between them.
## Description `index2Q2`
It is a javaScript file that will give you an array of numbers in between what you have entered.For example, if the two numbers are 4 and 7, the output should be [4, 5, 6, 7] and -4 and 7 should return [-4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7].
# Challenge 3
You are tasked with writing a function that takes an array of numbers as input and returns a `new array` containing only the `prime numbers` from the original array. How would you implement this function efficiently, ensuring that it accurately identifies prime numbers and returns them in the same order they appear in the input array
## Description 
It is a Java Script file that identifies prime numbers in a given array and returns a new array containing those prime numbers in the same order they appear in the given array.For example if you provide an array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] it should return an array [2, 3, 5, 7].
